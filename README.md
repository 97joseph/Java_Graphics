# Java_Graphics

### Graphics simulation


Overview
Your major assignment in this course is to write a graphics application that generates a 3D scene that the user can interact with. Your
project will be implemented in Java, LWJGL and GLSL. There are a number of criteria that needs to be met when implementing your task.
This project will assess your understanding of the 3-dimensional theories taught in lectures, and the implementation of these in OpenGL
as covered in the lab classes. Feel free to use your creativity in this project - a portion of the marks will be assigned for interesting and
innovative features.

### REQUIREMENTS


The following course learning outcomes are assessed by completing this assessment:·
Skills:
S1.Construct a software application to display three dimensional graphics.
S2.Apply input handling techniques to manipulate an interactive video game.
S3.Analyse and debug the functionality and performance of interactive computer games.
S4. Implement computer animation using interpolation and simulation approaches.
S5. Implement data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer game engines.
Application of knowledge and skills:
A1. Create interactive video games to meet supplied specifications.
A2. Create a working game engine using inputs, graphics and animations.
Assessment Details
Your task is to implement a simple scene in 3D using OpenGL with GLSL with the main driver program written in Java. You are welcome to
use any code you have developed in your lab classes, but if you use code supplied as part of the course content then this should be
acknowledged both in the comments of the code as well as in your report. This assignment contains three (3) sections:
· Core components
· Extras
· Report


### MILESTONES


· Must contain at least two (2) different non-hierarchical objects not previously used in lab classes eg you can use something
where code has been supplied. Each must consist of at least 10 triangles as a minimum
· Must contain at least one (1) object that uses a hierarchical articulated structure (such as a human body– the lower-arm
connects to the upper-arm, which connects to the torso). This must either use a preset animation or be controlled by the
user. There must be at least one example of animation of subparts separate from other parts eg a helicopter travelling
horizontally while rotors are spinning.
· There must be at least two (2) light sources that objects respond to appropriately.
· At least one object should have a texture applied to it.
· The user should be able to interact with the scene. This may be moving one (or more) objects or the virtual camera around
with mouse or key input. The animation created should be independent of the computers speed running the application.
· Your scene should have some meaning, tell a story
It is up to you what your scene contains (adult rated content will not be accepted).
Extras
Percentage Value of Task: 20%
Minimum Time Expectation: 14 hours
To gain additional marks you will need to add more complexity to your scene. It is up to you how much extra you want to implement in
your scene. Some tasks you choose will be complex and will be worth more marks. If in doubt have a conversation with the course
coordinator. You do not have to limit what you do to the following list. This list is just some suggested extensions:
· Use a complex hierarchical structure with complex animation.
· Supplied are some example BVH files. You could write a loader for these and build your hierarchical articulated structure and
animate it with these files.
· Use of shader programs not used in lab classes (eg a cel or toon shader). You will need to be able to explain what your shader
does and how it works in your report.
· More than one shader program used in your scene
· Use of multiple light sources.
· Generation of complex shapes such as extruded shapes
· Write an .obj loader and load a more complex mesh.
· Use of advanced texturing techniques such as multi-texturing, bump, cube, displacement mapping.
· Use of techniques such as fog, shadows.
·     Implement simple physics-based animation for objects (either those controlled by the user, and/or other objects)
·     Implement simple collision detection between graphical/game objects using bounding volumes.
